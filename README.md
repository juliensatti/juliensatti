👋 Hi, I’m @juliensatti!

👀 I’m a software architect, full-stack engineer and entrepreneur interested in many other things...

🌱 I’ve graduated from Polytech' Nice Sophia (engineering degree) and IAE Nice (master), in 2023, as valedictorian (in both!).

💞️ I’m open to collaborate on all sorts of projects where I can make the difference.
